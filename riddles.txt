I whistle when the winds blow, I watch others change, but never do so\nI drop needles for someone, maybe no-one to find\npeople seek me out when they want piece of mind\nFeeling blue though I'm always with my friends, for me the spring time never ends\n(two lowercase words)|blue spruce

|I show you the part of you that you will never know\nWhen I’m good, time moves fast\nWhen I’m bad, time moves slow\nEither way you’ll forget me in the morning glow(two lowercase words : a  ……)|a dream


Embodying your emotion\nCausing a commotion\nsending shivers up your spine\nYou hunger for the way I feel, line after line\nMy absence is heavy\nBut you’re in my presence plenty\n(one lowercase word)|sound

Insatiable hunger\nI give life, but only take\nThe things I break dissipate\nPeople look at me and contemplate\nThey see they’re, life they see their fate\nThey need the heat I emanate(one lowercase word)|fire

Hung for your convenience\nAlways the same question\nHe will answer you in time\nAlways working in his hands\nHe watches you pass your prime\nHe counts as you wither in your bed\nTik tik tik, you hear him in your head(two lowercase words: a  ……)|a clock

Like ink on paper, when barren i bleed into my surroundings in tendrils \nMy figure,  cracks like broken glass upon the blue sky\nRough, battered, and beaten by the wind, I stand strong upon the hills\nAm i dead, you do not know\nThey sang to me before the snow(two lowercase words: a ……)|a tree
