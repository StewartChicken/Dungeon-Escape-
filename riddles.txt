I whistle when the winds blow, I watch others change, but never do so. I drop needles for someone, maybe no-one, to find. People seek me out when they want piece of mind. Feeling blue though Im always with my friends, for me the spring time never ends.(two lowercase words)|blue spruce

I show you the part of you that you will never know. When Im good, time moves fast. When Im bad, time moves slow. Either way youll forget me in the morning glow.(two lowercase words : a ****)|a dream

Embodying your emotion, causing a commotion, sending shivers up your spine, you hunger for the way I feel, line after line. My absence is heavy, but youre in my presence plenty. (one lowercase word)|music

Insatiable hunger. I give life, but only take. The things I break dissipate. People look at me and contemplate. They see theyre, life they see their fate. They need the heat I emanate(one lowercase word)|fire

Hung for your convenience. Always the same question. He will answer you in time. Always working in his hands. He watches you pass your prime. He counts as you wither in your bed. Tik tik tik, you hear him in your head(two lowercase words: a  ***** )|a clock

Like ink on paper, when barren I bleed into my surroundings in tendrils. My figure,  cracks like broken glass upon the blue sky. Rough, battered, and beaten by the wind, I stand strong upon the hills. Am I dead? You do not know. They sang to me before the snow.(two lowercase words: a ****)|a tree
